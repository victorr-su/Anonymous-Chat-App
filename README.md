## Why did i build this?
- Ever since I started dabbling in front-end web development, I've always wanted to try and start utilizing

## What technolgoies were used?
- Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, and Chat engine API
- Majority of styles from : https://gist.github.com/adrianhajdin/c3a3195dd091359f3402a572961abb98
